    "text": "The folders inside this folder should contain all data at various stages.\nThis data is being loaded/manipulated/changed/saved with code from the code folders.\nYou should place the raw data in the raw_data folder and not edit it. Ever!\nIdeally, load the raw data into R and do all changes there with code, so everything is automatically reproducible and documented.\nSometimes, you need to edit the files in the format you got. For instance, Excel files are sometimes so poorly formatted that it’s close to impossible to read them into R, or the persons you got the data from used color to code some information, which of course won’t import into R. In those cases, you might have to make modifications in a software other than R. If you need to make edits in whatever format you got the data (e.g. Excel), make a copy and place those copies in a separate folder, AND ONLY EDIT THOSE COPIES. Also, write down somewhere the edits you made.\nAdd as many sub-folders as suitable. If you only have a single processing step, one sub-folder for processed data is enough. If you have multiple stages of cleaning and processing, additional sub-folders might be useful. Adjust based on the complexity of your project.\nI suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data:\nhttp://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata"

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at /Users/taylorglass/Documents/MADA /taylorglass-MADA-portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

    "text": "Correlation between number and severity of symptoms\nThe data we have available reports most of the symptoms as absence or presence. If more symptoms correlate positively with stronger symptoms, using absence/presence data only is a valid, albeit less powerful approach. More problematically is a situation in which the number and strength of symptoms correlate negatively. For example, a person having fewer symptoms might “make up” for the lower number of symptoms by having a more severe form. Such a relation would invalidate our approach of adding presence/absence symptoms to arrive at a given score. While we cannot thoroughly test potential correlations between the quantity and strength of symptoms on all our data, we do have severity information on the cough, weakness, and body aches symptoms. This allows us to evaluate the relation between the number of symptoms and the severity of those symptoms.\nWe find that as the number of infectiousness-related symptoms (i.e., our infectiousness scores) increases, there is an increase in cough intensity (SM Figure @ref(fig:Infect1CoughFig)). The same relationship is found between the number of morbidity-related symptoms (i.e., our morbidity scores) and the severity of weakness and body aches (SM Figures @ref(fig:Morbidity1WeaknessFig) and @ref(fig:Morbidity1BodyAchesFig)). While not conclusive, this evidence suggests that our assumption that symptom absence/presence also captures symptom severity seems to be defensible.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelationship between cough intensity and the infectiousness score from main text using all Y/N variables plausibly related to infectiousness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelationship between weakness intensity and the morbidity score from main text using all Y/N variables related to morbidity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelationship between body ache intensity and the morbidity score from main text using all Y/N variables related to morbidity."

    "text": "Alternative approaches to calculate the infectiousness score\nIn the main text, we use all of the available yes/no symptoms that can feasibly be related to infectiousness. Since there is no consensus about which symptoms or routes of transmission are the most important, we also consider how robust the results are using several different versions of infectiousness scores.\nWhile chest congestion might be a proxy for pathogen load, i.e., more congestion could indicate higher levels of a pathogen, in which case it could impact infectiousness. However, it is true that chest congestion alone without coughing or sneezing might not lead to increased infectiousness (though some recent studies suggest that breathing alone accounts for a large fraction of expelled influenza virions [1]). To explore if inclusion or exclusion of chest congestion in the infectiousness scores made a difference, we created a score excluding it to see if the overall conclusions would change. The new score values ranged from 0 to 4 (SM Figure @ref(fig:InfectScore2Fig)A).\nThe same overall relationship is observed between the new infectiousness score and activity. There is still a curve. Spearman’s rank correlation indicates a negative relationship with (\\(r=\\) -0.11 (95% CI: -0.22, -0.00)) and the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel trend test is statistically significant (\\(\\chi^2 =\\) 3.772, \\(df =\\) 1, \\(p\\) 0.05) (SM Figure @ref(fig:InfectScore2Fig)B).\nWhen compared to the morbidity score, the same overall trends from the primary analysis were observed. Spearman’s rank correlation (\\(r=\\) 0.17 (95% CI: 0.06, 0.27)) and the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel trend test is statistically significant (\\(\\chi^2 =\\) 11.323, \\(df =\\) 1, \\(p\\) &lt; 0.01). We find a mean 1.5 fold increase in the new infectiousness score going from the lowest to the highest morbidity score (SM Figure @ref(fig:InfectScore2Fig)C).\n\n\n\n\n\nInfectiousness score without chest congestion\n\n\n\n\nHow patients define congestion symptoms is very subjective [2], so we created a score excluding both of the congestion-related variables to see if the overall conclusions would change. The new score could have a value of 0 to 3 (SM Figure @ref(fig:InfectScore3Fig)A).\nThe same overall relationship is observed between the new infectiousness score and activity. The curved relationship is not as clear but still present. Spearman’s rank correlation indicates negative relationship with (\\(r=\\) -0.11 (95% CI: -0.22, -0.00)) and the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel trend test is statistically significant (\\(\\chi^2 =\\) 4.599, \\(df =\\) 1, \\(p\\) 0.03) (SM Figure @ref(fig:InfectScore3Fig)B).\nWhen compared to the morbidity score again, the same trends were observed, and Spearman’s rank correlation indicates positive relationship (\\(r=\\) 0.16 (95% CI: 0.05, 0.26)) and the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel trend test is statistically significant (\\(\\chi^2 =\\) 10.023, \\(df =\\) 1, \\(p\\) &lt; 0.01). We find a mean 1.5 fold increase in the new infectiousness score going from the lowest to the highest morbidity score (SM Figure @ref(fig:InfectScore3Fig)C).\n\n\n\n\n\nInfectiousness score without chest and nasal congestion variables\n\n\n\n\nFor the score used in the main text, we included all relevant symptoms even if they can be considered strongly related. This might lead to potential double-counting of some symptoms. To evaluate if this might cause problems, we created an alternative score that removed highly correlated variables based on two cut off values of Yule’s Q [3]. There is no commonly used value to define a cut-off at which correlated variables should be removed. We decided to use an absolute correlation of 0.9 or 0.75 for our cut off. When using the 0.9 cut off only very strongly correlated variables were removed, while for the 0.75 even intermediately strong correlations lead to the removal of one of the variables [4]. For any pair of symptoms with a positive or negative correlation of 0.9 or greater, the more informative symptom (having the proportion Yes/No closest to 50%) was kept[5]. For our data, cough and chest congestion had a Yule’s Q of 0.933, and chest congestion had the best balance between yes and no responses, so it was kept. When relaxing the correlation to 0.75, there is no change in the variables included in the score.\nThe score values range from 0 to 4 (SM Figure @ref(fig:InfectScore4Fig)A). The same overall relationship is observed between the new infectiousness score and activity. The curve is present, Spearman’s rank correlation indicates negative relationship with (\\(r=\\) -0.16 (95% CI: -0.26, -0.05)) and the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel trend test is statistically significant (\\(\\chi^2 =\\) 7.138, \\(df =\\) 1, \\(p\\) &lt; 0.01) (SM Figure @ref(fig:InfectScore4Fig)B).\nWhen compared to the morbidity score again the same overall trends were observed with Spearman’s rank correlation indicates positive relationship (\\(r=\\) 0.28 (95% CI: 0.18, 0.38)) and the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel trend test is statistically significant (\\(\\chi^2 =\\) 25.818, \\(df =\\) 1, \\(p\\) &lt; 0.01). We find a mean 2.1 fold increase in the new infectiousness score going from the lowest to the highest morbidity score (SM Figure @ref(fig:InfectScore4Fig)C).\n\n\n\n\n\nInfectiousness score removing variables determined to be redundant based on Yule’s Q"

    "text": "Alternative approaches to calculate morbidity score\nTo see the impact of removing correlated variables from the morbidity score, we used the same methods applied to the infectiousness score above. Among the morbidity symptoms, only vomiting and weakness correlated greater than 0.9. Vomiting was included in the score since it was more balanced then weakness, which was present in 94% of patients. This score using 0.9 cut off had a possible range of 0 to 19. There are no patients with a morbidity score of 0,1,18,19 (SM Figure @ref(fig:ImpactScore2Fig)A). The same relationships observed in the main text are seen when the morbidity score is compared to activity and infectiousness scores.\nThere is a negative correlation between the morbidity score, and the patient’s self-reported activity level suggests that higher morbidity score is associated with reduced activity levels. Spearman’s rank correlation indicates negative relationship (\\(r=\\) -0.31 (95% CI: -0.41, -0.21)) and the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel trend test is statistically significant (\\(\\chi^2 =\\) 36.004, \\(df =\\) 1, \\(p\\) &lt; 0.01).

Starting with the highest correlations first: Weakness/Vomit (Q=1) keep vomit, Tooth pain/Headache (Q=.86) keep Tooth pain, Chills Sweats/SoreThroat (Q=-.8) keep Chills Sweats, Fatigue/BodyAches (Q=.80) keep BodyAches, Vomit/Nausea (Q=.79) keep Nausea, SubjectiveFever/ChillsSweats (Q=.76) keep SubjectiveFever. The 0.75 cut off morbidity score included Subjective Fever, Myalgia, Sleeplessness, Breathlessness, Wheezing, Chest pain, Abdominal Pain, Diarrhea, Nausea, Ear Pain, Tooth pain, Eye pain, Itchy Eyes, and Swollen Lymph Nodes. This morbidity score has a possible value of 0 to 14. Compared to the morbidity score used in the main text and 0.9 cut off there are now 12 patients with a score of 0 or 1, but there are still no patients with a score of 13 or 14. (SM Figure @ref(fig:ImpactScore3Fig)A). Again the overall results remain the same despite using a different version of the score.\nThere is a negative correlation between the morbidity score and the patient’s self-reported activity level. Spearman’s rank correlation indicates negative relationship (\\(r=\\) -0.26 (95% CI: -0.36, -0.16)) and the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel trend test is statistically significant (\\(\\chi^2 =\\) 24.987, \\(df =\\) 1, \\(p\\) &lt; 0.01).

    "text": "Exploring CDC Data: Vaccination Coverage Among Pregnant Women\n\n\nDescription of the data\nI found this data set from the CDC’s data log under the pregnancy and vaccination section. The data was provided by the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD), and the information was collected through the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS). Information includes vaccination rates at the state level for influenza and tetanus toxoid, reduced diptheria toxoid, and aceullar pertussis (Tdap) for women who recently gave birth. Variables include vaccine type, geography, survey year/influenza season, dimension (age or race), and estimation of vaccination coverage with 95% confidence interval. It was most recently updated on December 15, 2023 and contains 4,379 observations of 9 variables. Link: https://data.cdc.gov/Pregnancy-Vaccination/Vaccination-Coverage-among-Pregnant-Women/h7pm-wmjc/about_data\n\n\nRead and load the data\nI loaded two packages for this step: readr and here. I called the data ‘pregvacc’. After reading and loading the data, I confirmed that there were 4,379 observations of 9 variables.\n\n## load packages\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(here)\n\nhere() starts at /Users/taylorglass/Documents/MADA /taylorglass-MADA-portfolio\n\n##read in data and find dimensions\npregvacc &lt;- read_csv(here(\"cdcdata-exercise\", \"Vaccination_Coverage_among_Pregnant_Women_20240205.csv\"))\n\nRows: 4379 Columns: 9\n\n\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (7): Vaccine, Geography Type, Geography, Dimension Type, Dimension, Esti...\ndbl (2): Survey Year/Influenza Season, Sample Size\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\ndim(pregvacc)\n\n[1] 4379    9\n\n\n\n\nProcessing the data\nUsing the naniar package to discover missingness of the data shows that this data set is pretty clean. Sample size is the only variable with missing data, and it has 215 missing observations. Sample size is an important variable for determining the reliability of the vaccination coverage estimation percentages. The ‘data quality’ section of the CDC page for this data set notes that observations marked with an asterisk are unreliable due to a sample size of less than 30. After exploring the variable, the minimum value is exactly 30, so none of the estimates are less than 30. I feel confident in removing this variable from the data set because all of the vaccination coverage estimates with complete data are reliable based on the sample size variable.\n\n## load packages\nlibrary(naniar)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(stringr)\n\n## explore missingness of the data \ngg_miss_var(pregvacc)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsum(is.na(pregvacc$`Sample Size`))\n\n[1] 215\n\nsummary(pregvacc$`Sample Size`)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's \n   30.0   167.0   320.5   797.2   655.2 43737.0     215 \n\n## create new dataset without the sample size variable\npregvacc2 &lt;- pregvacc %&gt;% select(-`Sample Size`)\n\nUsing the head() function, I saw “NR” in the estimate of vaccination coverage and confidence interval variables, which also represents missing data. With assistance from AI tools, I wrote a function to rid the data of any “NR” variables or special characters using the dplyr and stringr packages. I found that there are 442 missing observations of the estimate variable and confidence interval variables. Considering that the data set contains 4,379 observations, only 10% of the observations have a missing estimate value for vaccination coverage. I think it is okay to remove the missing observations in this scenario because each state has multiple observations across several years of PRAMS data. Information about vaccination among pregnant women is included for all 50 states based on various ages and races/ethnicities, so I think it is reasonable to remove 10% of the data set for this analysis.\n\n## examine data again \nhead(pregvacc2)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 8\n  Vaccine   `Geography Type` Geography Survey Year/Influenza …¹ `Dimension Type`\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;chr&gt;                        &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           \n1 Influenza States           Alaska                        2012 Age             \n2 Influenza States           Alaska                        2020 Age             \n3 Influenza States           Alaska                        2020 Race and Ethnic…\n4 Influenza States           Alaska                        2012 Age             \n5 Influenza States           Alaska                        2012 Race and Ethnic…\n6 Influenza States           Alaska                        2020 Age             \n# ℹ abbreviated name: ¹​`Survey Year/Influenza Season`\n# ℹ 3 more variables: Dimension &lt;chr&gt;, `Estimate (%)` &lt;chr&gt;, `95% CI (%)` &lt;chr&gt;\n\n## create a function to clean the data\nclean_data &lt;- function(data) {\n  data[data == 'NR*'] &lt;- NA\n  data &lt;- data %&gt;% mutate_if(is.character, str_replace_all, pattern = \"[^a-zA-Z0-9\\\\s]\", replacement = \"\")\n  return(data)\n}\n\n## use the clean_data function to create the third version of the dataset\npregvacc3 &lt;- clean_data(pregvacc2)\n\n## explore the new NAs created by the clean_data function \ngg_miss_var(pregvacc3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsum(is.na(pregvacc3$`Estimate (%)`))\n\n[1] 442\n\nsum(is.na(pregvacc3$`95% CI (%)`))\n\n[1] 442\n\nmissing &lt;- 442/4379*100\nhead(pregvacc3)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 8\n  Vaccine   `Geography Type` Geography Survey Year/Influenza …¹ `Dimension Type`\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;chr&gt;                        &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           \n1 Influenza States           Alaska                        2012 Age             \n2 Influenza States           Alaska                        2020 Age             \n3 Influenza States           Alaska                        2020 Race and Ethnic…\n4 Influenza States           Alaska                        2012 Age             \n5 Influenza States           Alaska                        2012 Race and Ethnic…\n6 Influenza States           Alaska                        2020 Age             \n# ℹ abbreviated name: ¹​`Survey Year/Influenza Season`\n# ℹ 3 more variables: Dimension &lt;chr&gt;, `Estimate (%)` &lt;chr&gt;, `95% CI (%)` &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\nAfter dropping the NA values, the data set contains 3,937 observations of 8 variables with no missing values.

I also had to divide the values by 100 once they were numeric, so it would be in a normal percentage format.\n\n## load packages \nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n## separate the confidence interval variable to convert it to numeric in a typical percent format\npregvacc4 &lt;- pregvacc4 %&gt;% \n                separate(`95% CI (%)`, into = c(\"95% CI Lower\", \"95% CI Upper\"), sep = \"to\", convert = TRUE)\nhead(pregvacc4) # check if separation worked\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 9\n  Vaccine   `Geography Type` Geography Survey Year/Influenza …¹ `Dimension Type`\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;chr&gt;                        &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           \n1 Influenza States           Alaska                        2012 Age             \n2 Influenza States           Alaska                        2020 Age             \n3 Influenza States           Alaska                        2012 Age             \n4 Influenza States           Alaska                        2020 Age             \n5 Influenza States           Alaska                        2020 Age             \n6 Influenza States           Alaska                        2020 Age             \n# ℹ abbreviated name: ¹​`Survey Year/Influenza Season`\n# ℹ 4 more variables: Dimension &lt;chr&gt;, `Estimate (%)` &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   `95% CI Lower` &lt;dbl&gt;, `95% CI Upper` &lt;int&gt;\n\npregvacc4 &lt;- pregvacc4 %&gt;% \n                mutate(`95% CI Lower` = as.numeric(`95% CI Lower`) / 100) %&gt;% \n                mutate(`95% CI Upper` = as.numeric(`95% CI Upper`) / 100)\nhead(pregvacc4) # check if mutation worked \n\n# A tibble: 6 × 9\n  Vaccine   `Geography Type` Geography Survey Year/Influenza …¹ `Dimension Type`\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;chr&gt;                        &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           \n1 Influenza States           Alaska                        2012 Age             \n2 Influenza States           Alaska                        2020 Age             \n3 Influenza States           Alaska                        2012 Age             \n4 Influenza States           Alaska                        2020 Age             \n5 Influenza States           Alaska                        2020 Age             \n6 Influenza States           Alaska                        2020 Age             \n# ℹ abbreviated name: ¹​`Survey Year/Influenza Season`\n# ℹ 4 more variables: Dimension &lt;chr&gt;, `Estimate (%)` &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   `95% CI Lower` &lt;dbl&gt;, `95% CI Upper` &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\n\n\nExploratory/Descriptive Analysis on the clean data\nAfter cleaning and processing the data, the final data set has 3,937 observations of 9 variables.

I used AI tools to help create a simple table displaying what percent is in each category.\n\n## find basic facts about final clean dataset\ndim(pregvacc4)\n\n[1] 3937    9\n\nstr(pregvacc4)\n\ntibble [3,937 × 9] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ Vaccine                     : chr [1:3937] \"Influenza\" \"Influenza\" \"Influenza\" \"Influenza\" ...\n $ Geography Type              : chr [1:3937] \"States\" \"States\" \"States\" \"States\" ...\n $ Geography                   : chr [1:3937] \"Alaska\" \"Alaska\" \"Alaska\" \"Alaska\" ...\n $ Survey Year/Influenza Season: num [1:3937] 2012 2020 2012 2020 2020 ...\n $ Dimension Type              : chr [1:3937] \"Age\" \"Age\" \"Age\" \"Age\" ...\n $ Dimension                   : chr [1:3937] \"18 Years\" \"18 Years\" \"35 Years\" \"35 Years\" ...\n $ Estimate (%)                : num [1:3937] 4.92 6.4 5.49 6.47 6.27 6.68 4.89 4.83 4.68 5.92 ...\n $ 95% CI Lower                : num [1:3937] 4.53 6.04 4.36 5.6 5.79 5.92 4.18 4.3 4.12 5.35 ...\n $ 95% CI Upper                : num [1:3937] 5.31 6.75 6.58 7.28 6.73 7.38 5.61 5.36 5.24 6.47 ...\n\n## create percentage table with categories of vaccine variable\nvacc_table &lt;- table(pregvacc4$Vaccine)\npercentage_table &lt;- prop.table(vacc_table) * 100\nprint(percentage_table)\n\n\nInfluenza      Tdap \n 66.67513  33.32487 \n\n\nUsing the code above as a template, I created a summary table for each categorical variable. The geography type variable is 95.9% states, with the other 4.1% of observations being at the national level. The geography categorical variable has 51 options with differentiation between New York City and the rest of New York state and inclusion of Puerto Rico. Wisconsin makes up the highest percentage of the geography variable with 4.06% of observations, and Indiana makes up the lowest percentage at 0.2% of observation. The two dimension types are split almost evenly with 55.65% of observations belonging to age and 44.35% of observations belonging to race and ethnicity. There are 4 categories for age: 18 years, 18-24 years, 25-34 years, and 35 years. Each of these age categories account for about 14% of dimension observations. There are 4 categories for race/ethnicity: Black Non-Hispanic, Hispanic, Other or Multiple Races Non-Hispanic, and White Non-Hispanic. White Non-Hispanic is the largest of the race and ethnicity categories with 13.86% of observations for the dimension variable.\n\n## create percentage table with categories of geography type variable\ngeotype_table &lt;- table(pregvacc4$`Geography Type`)\npercentage_table2 &lt;- prop.table(geotype_table) * 100\nprint(percentage_table2)\n\n\n National    States \n 4.064008 95.935992 \n\n## create percentage table with categories of geography variable\ngeo_table &lt;- table(pregvacc4$Geography)\npercentage_table3 &lt;- prop.table(geo_table) * 100\nprint(percentage_table3)\n\n\n             Alabama               Alaska              Arizona \n           1.2446025            1.5494031            0.1778004 \n            Arkansas             Colorado          Connecticut \n           1.9558039            3.0988062            1.6256033 \n            Delaware District of Columbia              Florida \n           4.0132080            0.7112014            0.3556007 \n             Georgia               Hawaii             Illinois \n           1.2192024            2.1082042            2.8194056 \n             Indiana                 Iowa               Kansas \n           0.2032004            2.3114046            0.8890018 \n            Kentucky            Louisiana                Maine \n           0.6096012            2.2606045            1.2954026 \n            Maryland        Massachusetts             Michigan \n           1.8288037            3.2512065            2.9464059 \n           Minnesota          Mississippi             Missouri \n           1.8288037            1.2192024            3.4798070 \n             Montana             Nebraska        New Hampshire \n           1.6256033            2.8448057            1.6510033 \n          New Jersey           New Mexico             New York \n           2.0320041            1.9558039            3.2004064 \n      North Carolina         North Dakota   NYCity of New York \n           0.6096012            0.8128016            3.4544069 \n     NYRest of state                 Ohio             Oklahoma \n           2.7178054            0.5588011            3.0226060 \n              Oregon         Pennsylvania          Puerto Rico \n           1.4224028            3.8608077            0.6350013 \n        Rhode Island         South Dakota            Tennessee \n           2.0320041            1.0160020            1.1176022 \n               Texas        United States                 Utah \n           0.8128016            4.0640081            2.7686055 \n             Vermont             Virginia           Washington \n           2.4384049            2.6416053            3.2512065 \n       West Virginia            Wisconsin              Wyoming \n           1.1430023            4.0640081            1.2446025 \n\n## create percentage table with categories of dimension type variable\ndimtype_table &lt;- table(pregvacc4$`Dimension Type`)\npercentage_table3 &lt;- prop.table(dimtype_table) * 100\nprint(percentage_table3)\n\n\n               Age Race and Ethnicity \n          55.65151           44.34849 \n\n## create percentage table with categories of dimension variable\ndim_table &lt;- table(pregvacc4$Dimension)\npercentage_table4 &lt;- prop.table(dim_table) * 100\nprint(percentage_table4)\n\n\n                           18 Years                          1824 Years \n                          14.020828                           13.944628 \n                         2534 Years                            35 Years \n                          14.020828                           13.665227 \n                  Black NonHispanic                            Hispanic \n                           9.728219                           10.820422 \nOther or Multiple Races NonHispanic                   White NonHispanic \n                           9.931420                           13.868428 \n\n\nTo explore the continuous variables, I will make plots to see if they are approximately normal. The mean of the vaccination estimate among pregnant women is 6.23%, and the standard deviation is 1.497. I had to convert the estimate variable to a factor to create a bar graph that displayed each of the unique discrete observations. The distribution looks approximately normal, but it is slightly skewed to the left.\n\n## load packages \nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n## find summary values while variable is numeric \nmean(pregvacc4$`Estimate (%)`)\n\n[1] 6.233548\n\nsd(pregvacc4$`Estimate (%)`)\n\n[1] 1.496931\n\n## convert variable to factor to be visualized\npregvacc4 &lt;- pregvacc4 %&gt;% \n                mutate(`Estimate (%)` = as.factor(`Estimate (%)`))\nclass(pregvacc4$`Estimate (%)`) ## check if mutation worked \n\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n## create visualization of the distribution of estimate (%) variable\nggplot(pregvacc4, aes(x=`Estimate (%)`)) + \n    geom_bar(position = \"dodge\") + \n    labs(x = \"Estimate of Vaccination Percentage\",\n         y= \"Frequency\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI would expect the lower and upper bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) to have the same distribution as the estimate variable because the estimate variable is used to calculate the CI. Before converting the variables to a factor type to create the bar graph, I found the mean and standard deviation for each one while the variable was still numeric. The mean for the lower bound of the 95% CI 5.56%, and the standard deviation was 1.53. The mean for the upper bound of the 95% CI is 6.86%, and the standard deviation is 1.46. After creating two more bar graphs using the variables as factors, my expectations were met, and each distribution for the bounds of the confidence interval are approximately normal with a slight skew to the left.\n\n## find summary values while variable is numeric \nmean(pregvacc4$`95% CI Lower`)\n\n[1] 5.555558\n\nsd(pregvacc4$`95% CI Lower`)\n\n[1] 1.531577\n\n## find summary values while variable is numeric\nmean(pregvacc4$`95% CI Upper`)\n\n[1] 6.86397\n\nsd(pregvacc4$`95% CI Upper`)\n\n[1] 1.463774\n\n## convert variable to factor to be visualized \npregvacc4 &lt;- pregvacc4 %&gt;% \n                mutate(`95% CI Lower` = as.factor(`95% CI Lower`))\nclass(pregvacc4$`95% CI Lower`) ## check if conversion worked\n\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n##create visualization of the distribution of 95% CI Lower variable\nggplot(pregvacc4, aes(x=`95% CI Lower`)) + \n    geom_bar(position = \"dodge\") + \n    labs(x = \"Lower Bound of 95% Confidence Interval for Estimate\",\n         y= \"Frequency\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## convert variable to factor to be visualized \npregvacc4 &lt;- pregvacc4 %&gt;% \n                mutate(`95% CI Upper` = as.factor(`95% CI Upper`))\nclass(pregvacc4$`95% CI Upper`) ## check if conversion worked\n\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n##create visualization of the distribution of 95% CI Upper variable\nggplot(pregvacc4, aes(x=`95% CI Upper`)) + \n    geom_bar(position = \"dodge\") + \n    labs(x = \"Upper Bound of 95% Confidence Interval for Estimate\",\n         y= \"Frequency\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCassia Roth created this section.\nFirst, lets make sure we have all necessary packages loaded.\n\n#Load required packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ purrr     1.0.2\n✔ lubridate 1.9.2     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nlibrary(skimr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'skimr'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:naniar':\n\n    n_complete\n\nlibrary(gtsummary)\n\n#BlackLivesMatter\n\n\nNext, I asked ChatGPT the following prompt: Can you write R code that generates a dataset of 3937 observations of vaccination status for women who recently gave birth. Women are between 18 and 35 years. The dataset should include seven variables (vaccine, state, year, age, race/ethnicity, estimate of vaccine coverage in percentage, 95% CI lower, 95% CI upper). 66% of the vaccination observations should be influenza vaccines and 33 percent should be Tdap vaccines. Then, given Table 4 Tessa created above, I put that into ChatGPT, so it should know the percentage of observations for each state. Then, I asked it to add code so that 50% of observations were in the age groups 18-24 and 50% were in the age groups 25-34; and that 21% of observations were Black-non Hispanic, 25% were Hispanic, 31% were White non-Hispanic, and 23% were Other. Last, I asked it to make sure the years for the data were between 2012 and 2021. I also asked it to make sure that the mean vaccination coverage was 6.23% with a standard deviation of 1.497. I finally asked it to calculate the 95% confidence interval for the mean vaccination coverage and display it.

    "text": "The Basics\nI am currently in the graduate year for my Master of Public Health in Biostatistics, so I have been living in Athens for over 4 years now. I am a Double Dawg here at the University of Georgia, and I have a bachelor’s of science in Health Promotion, which allowed me to get a head start on my MPH. I took my first biostatistics class during my freshman year, and I have been excited to learn more about this topic ever since. I chose this area of emphasis because I love combining my affinity for math with real public health problems. I really enjoy data visualization and translating findings from research studies into a format that can be understood by everyone. I hope to have a career that allows me to use my data analysis skills on projects that make a positive difference in population health.\n\n\nResearch Interests\nI am currently on Dr. Lambert and Dr. Swartzendruber’s research team working on their Crisis Pregnancy Center map. I completed my undergraduate internship with this team, and I spent most of my time completing qualitative data collection forms and developing codebooks. I continued my work in the fall of 2023 as the co-team leader for the content analysis team, which required me to manage 6 research assistants and complete weekly quality assurance checks of the data collection surveys. I love working in reproductive health research, and I am also interested in exploring research in the antimicrobial resistance and clinical trials for drug development spaces in the future.\n\n\nData Analysis Experience\nMost of my data analysis training has been hands-on with the CPC map project through using tools such as REDCap. I took the EPID 7500 elective in the fall of 2023, which gave me a great foundation for working with R studio. I also took BIOS 8110 in the same semester, which is a categorical data analysis class that allowed me to explore more advanced statistical methods. Both of these courses included a final project that required using a real-world data set to formula research questions, clean the data to answer these questions, and create a report with the findings.\n\n\nGoals For The Course\nI hope to become more comfortable with learning new data analysis tools using the resources provided during this course. I am often initially intimidated when it comes to learning new software and techniques, so I want to become better at adapting to new analysis tools. I am new to Github, so I am excited to create a presence in that space while learning how to utilize Gitkracken. While I have used AI tools sparingly, I am also looking forward to understanding more about how they function and how they can help me in my future career.\n\n\nFun Facts\nI am a huge foodie, so I spend the majority of my day planning meals, brainstorming ideas for the next party spread, or planning vacations to hot spots with new restaurants. Some of my favorite restaurants in Athens are Last Resort Grill, Thai Spoon, and Maepole. I love watching the Dawgs play, and I think game days are my favorite time to be in Athens. One unique thing about me is that I have the same birthday as my best friend, and we have spent the past 16 years celebrating together. Something curious about me: I actually grew up as an Auburn fan because my dad went there, but I will be cheering for the Dawgs from now on.\n\n\n\nMe in NYC at my favorite restaurant, Via Carota\n\n\n\n\nInteresting Data Analysis Predictions\nUpside is a website run by The Data Warehousing Institute with the majority of articles written by professional technology authors and some contributions from those within the data analytics community. A recently published article predicted the upcoming trends for generative AI in 2024. The most interesting prediction suggests an expansion of generative AI to support customer service with only meager large-scale investments in AI due to data security concerns. Additional topics discussed in the article include data lakehouses, Microsoft Fabric, and cloud analytics. I find the new platforms and companies involved in each of these data analysis topics to be really interesting because involvement in AI seems to be the hottest topic in current events recently."

The summary() function allowed me to see what Dr. Handle meant by R keeping all the continent categories but plugging in a zero as a placeholder.\n\nhead(gapminder) ##I see a variable name called continent that I will use to filter the dataset\n\n              country year infant_mortality life_expectancy fertility\n1             Albania 1960           115.40           62.87      6.19\n2             Algeria 1960           148.20           47.50      7.65\n3              Angola 1960           208.00           35.98      7.32\n4 Antigua and Barbuda 1960               NA           62.97      4.43\n5           Argentina 1960            59.87           65.39      3.11\n6             Armenia 1960               NA           66.86      4.55\n  population          gdp continent          region\n1    1636054           NA    Europe Southern Europe\n2   11124892  13828152297    Africa Northern Africa\n3    5270844           NA    Africa   Middle Africa\n4      54681           NA  Americas       Caribbean\n5   20619075 108322326649  Americas   South America\n6    1867396           NA      Asia    Western Asia\n\nafricadata &lt;- gapminder %&gt;% \n                filter(continent == \"Africa\")  ##I created a new dataset that only includes African countries\nstr(africadata) \n\n'data.frame':   2907 obs. of  9 variables:\n $ country         : Factor w/ 185 levels \"Albania\",\"Algeria\",..: 2 3 18 22 26 27 29 31 32 33 ...\n $ year            : int  1960 1960 1960 1960 1960 1960 1960 1960 1960 1960 ...\n $ infant_mortality: num  148 208 187 116 161 ...\n $ life_expectancy : num  47.5 36 38.3 50.3 35.2 ...\n $ fertility       : num  7.65 7.32 6.28 6.62 6.29 6.95 5.65 6.89 5.84 6.25 ...\n $ population      : num  11124892 5270844 2431620 524029 4829291 ...\n $ gdp             : num  1.38e+10 NA 6.22e+08 1.24e+08 5.97e+08 ...\n $ continent       : Factor w/ 5 levels \"Africa\",\"Americas\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ region          : Factor w/ 22 levels \"Australia and New Zealand\",..: 11 10 20 17 20 5 10 20 10 10 ...\n\nsummary(africadata)\n\n         country          year      infant_mortality life_expectancy\n Algeria     :  57   Min.   :1960   Min.   : 11.40   Min.   :13.20  \n Angola      :  57   1st Qu.:1974   1st Qu.: 62.20   1st Qu.:48.23  \n Benin       :  57   Median :1988   Median : 93.40   Median :53.98  \n Botswana    :  57   Mean   :1988   Mean   : 95.12   Mean   :54.38  \n Burkina Faso:  57   3rd Qu.:2002   3rd Qu.:124.70   3rd Qu.:60.10  \n Burundi     :  57   Max.   :2016   Max.   :237.40   Max.   :77.60  \n (Other)     :2565                  NA's   :226                     \n   fertility       population             gdp               continent   \n Min.   :1.500   Min.   :    41538   Min.   :4.659e+07   Africa  :2907  \n 1st Qu.:5.160   1st Qu.:  1605232   1st Qu.:8.373e+08   Americas:   0  \n Median :6.160   Median :  5570982   Median :2.448e+09   Asia    :   0  \n Mean   :5.851   Mean   : 12235961   Mean   :9.346e+09   Europe  :   0  \n 3rd Qu.:6.860   3rd Qu.: 13888152   3rd Qu.:6.552e+09   Oceania :   0  \n Max.   :8.450   Max.   :182201962   Max.   :1.935e+11                  \n NA's   :51      NA's   :51          NA's   :637                        \n                       region   \n Eastern Africa           :912  \n Western Africa           :912  \n Middle Africa            :456  \n Northern Africa          :342  \n Southern Africa          :285  \n Australia and New Zealand:  0  \n (Other)                  :  0  \n\n\nTo create two new objects from the ‘africadata’ object with only two columns each, I used the select() function to choose the columns I wanted to keep. The first object, ‘IMLE’, contains the infant mortality rates and life expectancies for each African country. I used the str() function to see there are 2907 observations of 2 variables, and the summary() function provides 5 data points for each numeric variable. The second object, “PLE’, contains the population and life expectancies for each African county. Similarly, I used str() to confirm there are 2907 observations of 2 variables, and the summary() function to learn about the range of each variable.\n\nIMLE &lt;- africadata %&gt;%  ##store a new object using the arrow notation\n        select(\"infant_mortality\", \"life_expectancy\") ##pipe in the filtered dataset and select specific columns \nstr(IMLE) ##confirm there are only 2 variables \n\n'data.frame':   2907 obs. of  2 variables:\n $ infant_mortality: num  148 208 187 116 161 ...\n $ life_expectancy : num  47.5 36 38.3 50.3 35.2 ...\n\nsummary(IMLE) ##observe the range of each numerical variable\n\n infant_mortality life_expectancy\n Min.   : 11.40   Min.   :13.20  \n 1st Qu.: 62.20   1st Qu.:48.23  \n Median : 93.40   Median :53.98  \n Mean   : 95.12   Mean   :54.38  \n 3rd Qu.:124.70   3rd Qu.:60.10  \n Max.   :237.40   Max.   :77.60  \n NA's   :226                     \n\nPLE &lt;- africadata %&gt;%  ##store a new object using the arrow notation\n          select(\"population\", \"life_expectancy\") ##pipe in the filtered dataset and select specific columns \nstr(PLE) ##confirm there are only 2 variables \n\n'data.frame':   2907 obs. of  2 variables:\n $ population     : num  11124892 5270844 2431620 524029 4829291 ...\n $ life_expectancy: num  47.5 36 38.3 50.3 35.2 ...\n\nsummary(PLE) ##observe the range of each numerical variable\n\n   population        life_expectancy\n Min.   :    41538   Min.   :13.20  \n 1st Qu.:  1605232   1st Qu.:48.23  \n Median :  5570982   Median :53.98  \n Mean   : 12235961   Mean   :54.38  \n 3rd Qu.: 13888152   3rd Qu.:60.10  \n Max.   :182201962   Max.   :77.60  \n NA's   :51"

Using the IMLE object, I plotted infant mortality on the x axis and life expenctancy on the y axis using the aesthetics filter with ggplot. I added geom-point() to plot the data as points. I also chose to include a title, which I centered on the graph, to make the contents of the plot even clearer. This plot shows the inverse relationship between life expectancy and infant mortality. The graph shows a strong inverse relationship with only 3 major outliers. The majority of observations fall between an infant mortality rate of 30 to 150.\n\nIMLE %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x=infant_mortality, y=life_expectancy)) + ##use aesthetic layer to set the axis variables\n  geom_point() + ##create a scatter plot\n  labs(title = \"Life Expectancy as a Function of Infant Mortality\") + ##label the graph with a title\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) ##center the title on the graph\n\nWarning: Removed 226 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI followed a similar process to plot life expectancy based on population using the PLE object. I used ggplot() again along with geom_point() to plot the data points. I used the same technique to create a title centered on the graph. I also added the scale_x_log10() function to convert the numeric population variable to the logarithmic scale, which helps to create a cleaner visualization. The graph shows the most observations around a population of 1 million with a life expectancy ranging from 40 to 60. There is one major outlier on the graph, but most observations are clustered to create easily definable streaks. The streaks of data in both of these graphs correspond to observations in each African country over the years included in the dataset, which range from 1960 to 2016. As time passes, life expectancy increases which causes the population size to increase. Since infant mortality has decreased over this time period, life expectancy is increasing. These trends show up as streaks in the data because each country’s observations are grouped together over time.\n\nPLE %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x=population, y=life_expectancy)) + ##use aesthetic layer to set the axis variables\n  geom_point() + ##create a scatter plot\n  labs(title = \"Life Expectancy as a Function of Population\") + ##label the graph with a title\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + ##center the title\n  scale_x_log10() ##change the x-axis to the log scale\n\nWarning: Removed 51 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`)."

While GDP accounts for the most missing observations, infant_mortality is the variable with the second most missing values. To determine which years have missing infant_mortality data, I used AI to learn how to use dplyr functions to filter for the specific missing data I am looking for. I filtered for observations where infant mortality rate was missing, and I selected the year column since that is the variable I am interested in. After printing the data, I realized it showed all 226 observations by year, so I used the unique() function to more efficiently determine which years had at least 1 missing infant mortality rate observation.

To see all of the states listed I use the function, levels().\n\nlevels(us_contagious_diseases$state) ##Examine the levels of the factor called states\n\n [1] \"Alabama\"              \"Alaska\"               \"Arizona\"             \n [4] \"Arkansas\"             \"California\"           \"Colorado\"            \n [7] \"Connecticut\"          \"Delaware\"             \"District Of Columbia\"\n[10] \"Florida\"              \"Georgia\"              \"Hawaii\"              \n[13] \"Idaho\"                \"Illinois\"             \"Indiana\"             \n[16] \"Iowa\"                 \"Kansas\"               \"Kentucky\"            \n[19] \"Louisiana\"            \"Maine\"                \"Maryland\"            \n[22] \"Massachusetts\"        \"Michigan\"             \"Minnesota\"           \n[25] \"Mississippi\"          \"Missouri\"             \"Montana\"             \n[28] \"Nebraska\"             \"Nevada\"               \"New Hampshire\"       \n[31] \"New Jersey\"           \"New Mexico\"           \"New York\"            \n[34] \"North Carolina\"       \"North Dakota\"         \"Ohio\"                \n[37] \"Oklahoma\"             \"Oregon\"               \"Pennsylvania\"        \n[40] \"Rhode Island\"         \"South Carolina\"       \"South Dakota\"        \n[43] \"Tennessee\"            \"Texas\"                \"Utah\"                \n[46] \"Vermont\"              \"Virginia\"             \"Washington\"          \n[49] \"West Virginia\"        \"Wisconsin\"            \"Wyoming\"             \n\n\nI found that the 51st state listed is District of Columbia. Since I am unsure if the Maryland values include or exclude District of Columbia, I will leave this state in the analysis but note this in the final figure.\nsummary() reveals that the years range from 1928 - 2011 and weeks reporting accounts for missing weeks. weeks reporting ranges from 0 - 52 which indicates some years with no data. I would like to find which years have missing data. A case count of 0 for any of the diseases is not necessarily missing data unless the there were 0 weeks_reporting for that year.\nBefore cleaning I will use gg_miss_var() to explore if there are any additional missing variables.\n\ngg_miss_var(us_contagious_diseases) ##find missing values\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems that some population data might be missing as well so I will also have to filter the population data that has “NA” or missing data."

I used the “bing” lexicon to assign positive or negative values to the words, and I used the ‘afinn’ lexicon to assign a score or value to each word. There are 4781 positive and 2005 negative words included in the ‘bing’ lexicon. There are only 16 words that get assigned the most negative score of -5 in the ‘afinn’ lexicon with most words scoring between a negative 3 and positive 3. Only 1 word is considered neutral with a score of 0. I used the inner_join function with the clean words tibble to assign a sentiment to the meaningful words. The top five words are all negative with ‘pig’,‘mad’, ‘mock’, ‘stole’, and ‘tired’ being assigned negative sentiments. To explore this observation further, I used the ‘afinn’ option to find the scores for each word.For example, ‘mad’ was assigned a -3 and ‘mock’ wass assigned a -2, which is interesting because I would consider ‘mock’ to be more negative than ‘mad’ personally.\n\n## install.packages(\"textdata\")\nlibrary(textdata)\nlibrary(tidytext)\nget_sentiments(\"bing\") %&gt;% count(sentiment)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  sentiment     n\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;int&gt;\n1 negative   4781\n2 positive   2005\n\nget_sentiments(\"afinn\") %&gt;% count(value)\n\n# A tibble: 11 × 2\n   value     n\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n 1    -5    16\n 2    -4    43\n 3    -3   264\n 4    -2   966\n 5    -1   309\n 6     0     1\n 7     1   208\n 8     2   448\n 9     3   172\n10     4    45\n11     5     5\n\nbing &lt;- get_sentiments(\"bing\") %&gt;% \n          select(word, sentiment)\nalice_bing &lt;- words_clean %&gt;% \n                inner_join(bing, by = \"word\", relationship = \"many-to-many\") \nhead(alice_bing)\n\n# A tibble: 0 × 4\n# ℹ 4 variables: gutenberg_id &lt;int&gt;, word &lt;chr&gt;, wordID &lt;int&gt;, sentiment &lt;chr&gt;\n\nafinn &lt;- get_sentiments(\"afinn\") %&gt;%\n          select(word, value)\nalice_affin &lt;-words_clean %&gt;% \n                inner_join(afinn, by =\"word\", relationship = \"many-to-many\")\nhead(alice_affin)\n\n# A tibble: 0 × 4\n# ℹ 4 variables: gutenberg_id &lt;int&gt;, word &lt;chr&gt;, wordID &lt;int&gt;, value &lt;dbl&gt;"

I used the ‘alice_affin’ dataset because it already includes the sentiment value assigned to each word. The smoother line on the scatterplot shows that the overall sentiment throughout the book hovers around neutral with slightly higher levels of positive words in the beginning. Words with a score of 2 and -2 are consistently spread throughout the book, which makes sense given most words receive those mild scores. The extremely positive words receiving a 4 on the ‘afinn’ scale are spread sparsely through the book. The most negative words receiving a score of -3 are seen more frequently throughout the book with a cluster around word number 12,500, which corresponds to the midpoint of the book roughly.

I assumed there were 250 words per page and created a new variable assigning word number to a page number in ‘alice_affin’. I computed the average sentiment per page to create a variable for the y-axis of the visualization and created a new datset grouped by that page variable called ‘pagesentiment’. The scatterplot shows a random distribution of average sentiment scores across all the pages of the book. The smoother line shows the first 60 pages are slightly more positive on the ‘affin’ scale while pages 60 to 90 are balanced to be fairly neutral. Around page 120, we see an increase in the average sentiment score, which makes sense because most stories like Alice’s Adventure in Wonderland end on a positive note.

As time progresses, the drug concentration sharply decreases until it reaches 0 around 48 hours.\nAs we look closer, some individuals received the drug more than once and have observations for both OCC=1 and OCC=2.

A better approach would be using integration to get the area under the curve with a simple trapezoid rule, but we will keep things simple here.

    "section": "Ask AI to recreate the original graph",
    "text": "Ask AI to recreate the original graph\nThis is the original prompt that I asked ChatGPT 3.5: R code to generate the graph titled “How worried are Americans about infection?” on this website https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/coronavirus-polls/ using the covid_concern_polls.csv file from this github repository https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/covid-19-polls\nI used the links to the website and GitHub repository to ensure that it knew which graph I am trying to recreate, which has been saved as Inspiration_graph.png in the presentation-exercise folder. The first step it gave me was to load three packages: readr, dplyr, and ggplot2. The second step was to save the data as an object, which I have already done. Next, it suggested filtering the data for the question regarding infection: “How worried are you about personally being infected with coronavirus?”. I made several modifications to the code because it did not know the object name that I stored my data in, and it did not know the exact verbiage of the question that was asked. This was not successful because I do not have one “estimate” for the percentage of people in each of the worry categories ranging from not_at_all to very. I should have known that this code would not be accurate because it said these steps will produce a polar bar graph when I am trying to produce a line graph. I commented out this code for the sake of rendering my website with this exercise.\n\n# load required packages\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# modified filtering code\n# concern_data &lt;- pollsdata %&gt;%\n # filter(text == \"How worried are you about you or someone in your family being infected with the Coronavirus??\") %&gt;%\n # select(starts_with(\"estimate\"))\n\nThis is the second prompt I asked ChatGPT: R code to produce a line graph with percentages of four different categories “very”, “somewhat”, “not very”, and “not at all” on the y-axis and time on the x-axis using the covid_concern_polls.csv file from this github repository https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/covid-19-polls\nI asked for a line graph specifically, and I know that I need to create variables with the percentages of each response category. I filtered for the subject of interest: “concern-infected” to limit the data to information about concern over Coronavrius infection. The graph models how concerned Americans are that they, someone in their family or someone else they know will be infected with Coronavirus, so I filtered for responses to all of the questions asking about concern over Coronavirus infections, which yielded 77 observations.\n\n# filter for all responses about Coronavirus concern\nconcern_data &lt;- pollsdata %&gt;% \n    filter(subject == \"concern-infected\")\n\nThe next suggestion from ChatGPT was to create percentages for each of the response variables. The first variable that had to be changed here is the grouping factor because modeldate was not included in the original dataset. Additionally, there were no “estimate” variables, so I just used the column names instead because each column had count data for that observation.\n\n# group data by date and calculate percentages for each category\nconcern_data2 &lt;- concern_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(end_date) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    very_percent = sum(very) / n(),\n    somewhat_percent = sum(somewhat) / n(),\n    not_very_percent = sum(not_very) / n(),\n    not_at_all_percent = sum(not_at_all) / n()\n  )\n\n# check that it worked \nstr(concern_data2)\n\ntibble [226 × 5] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ end_date          : Date[1:226], format: \"2020-02-04\" \"2020-02-09\" ...\n $ very_percent      : num [1:226] 13 11 11 22 16 10 16 19 23 30 ...\n $ somewhat_percent  : num [1:226] 26 24 28 23 24.5 30 31 33 32.5 32 ...\n $ not_very_percent  : num [1:226] 43 33 39 37 37.5 40 27 32.5 27 24 ...\n $ not_at_all_percent: num [1:226] 18 20 22 19 21 20 16 15 17 15 ...\n\n\nChatGPT suggested changing the shape of the data before attempting to visualize it. It did not account for the fact that I need the tidyr package to use the pivot_longer() function, so I loaded that package here. This transformation left me with a data set with 276 observations of 3 variables.\n\n# load packages\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n# convert shape of the dataset\nconcern_data_long &lt;- concern_data2 %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(very_percent, somewhat_percent, not_very_percent, not_at_all_percent),\n               names_to = \"Concern Level\",\n               values_to = \"Percentage\")\n\nLastly, I attempted to recreate the plot from the original webpage. The first attempt is not bad, but it looks like I have missing data in the “not_at_all_percent” variable which was not the case in the graph on the website.\n\n# attempt to recreate the original plot\ngraph1 &lt;- ggplot(concern_data_long, aes(x = end_date, y = Percentage, color = `Concern Level`)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(title = \"COVID-19 Concern Levels Over Time\",\n       x = \"Date\",\n       y = \"Percentage\",\n       color = \"Concern Level\") +\n  theme_minimal()\ngraph1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter finding there are 6 missing observations of the Percentage variable, I decided to omit those values because they account for such a minimal percentage of total observations, which fixed the strange gap in the line graph.\n\n# explore for missing data and remove it\nsum(is.na(concern_data_long$Percentage))\n\n[1] 8\n\nconcern_data_long &lt;- na.omit(concern_data_long)\n\n# check that missing data removal fixed the issue\ngraph2 &lt;- ggplot(concern_data_long, aes(x = end_date, y = Percentage, color = `Concern Level`)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(title = \"COVID-19 Concern Levels Over Time\",\n       x = \"Date\",\n       y = \"Percentage\",\n       color = \"Concern Level\") +\n  theme_minimal()\ngraph2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI need to make aesthetic changes, so the replicated graph matches the original graph more accurately. The title needs to be changed and centered. I used ChatGPT to create code to separate the title into three lines and change the size of the second title line, so it will fit better. I got a warning message that vectorized input to element_text is not supported in ggplot2, so all three lines of the title are the same size. The original x-axis labels each month, so I created custom labels and dropped the “date” label for the entire axis. While the original graph is interactive, that is slightly out of reach with my coding knowledge right now, so I decided to keep the stagnant legend. I noticed the legend was inverted, so I corrected that. I manually changed the colors of the lines using hex codes.\n\n# create 14 breaks for the x-axis and custom labels for each break\nbreaks &lt;- seq(as.Date(\"2020-02-28\"), by = \"month\", length.out = 14)\ncustom_labels &lt;- c(\"3/1/20\", \"4/1\", \"5/1\", \"6/1\", \"7/1\",\n                   \"8/1\", \"9/1\", \"10/1\", \"11/1\", \"12/1\", \"1/1/21\", \"2/1\", \"3/1\", \"4/1\")\n\n# create updated version of the graph with modifications\ngraph3 &lt;- ggplot(concern_data_long, aes(x = end_date, y = Percentage, color = `Concern Level`)) +\n    geom_line() +\n    scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#800080\",\"#BA55D3\",\"#FFDAB9\",\"#FF0000\")) +\n    labs(title = \"How worried are Americans about infection?\",\n         subtitle = paste(\"How concerned Americans say they are that they, someone in their family or someone else they know will\", \"\\n\", \"become infected with the coronavirus\")) +\n    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10), \n          plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 8)) +\n    scale_x_date(breaks = breaks, labels = custom_labels) +\n    xlab(NULL) + \n    guides(color = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE))\ngraph3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, I need to add labels on specific dates. I used this simple prompt in ChatGPT: how to add labels to specific dates on a line graph. It suggested adding a geom_text() layer. I had to go back and forth with ChatGPT a couple times to find a date format that worked. Unfortunately, I received a consistent error about the geom_text() layer not being able to find the Percentage variable which prevented it from adding the labels onto my existing graph. I attempted the same format with geom_label() and got the same error. I added an arbitrary Percentage variable to the labels_data just to see if that would fix the error, but it was also unsuccessful. I would appreciate any input on how to solve this error. I commented out the last piece of code for the sake of rendering my website.\n\n# create custom labels to be added as another layer on the original graph \nlabels_data &lt;- data.frame(\n  modeldate = as.Date(c(\"2020-02-29\", \"2020-05-28\", \"2020-10-02\", \"2020-11-07\", \"2021-01-02\")),  \n  label_text = c(\"First US death reported\", \"US deaths surpass 100,000\", \"Trump diagnosed with Covid-19\", \"Biden declared election winner\", \"Biden sworn into office\",\n  Percentage = c(60, 60, 60, 60, 60))\n)\n\n ## graph4 &lt;- graph3 + \n ##  geom_label(data = labels_data, aes(x = modeldate, y=Percentage, label = label_text))\n\nAfter receiving input from a classmate, Erick Mollinedo, I added several geom_vline() and geom_text() functions to add the missing labels. The geom_vline() functions created dashed lines on each of the important dates, which I think solved the previous issue because it provided a location for the new layer to be added to in ggplot(). The geom_text() functions allow the actual descriptions to be added. The labels were a little too large for my graph originally, so I changed the size of each one to make them fit better. This addition brought me much closer to replicating the original graph although my lines appear to be significantly more jagged than the original. I also received a suggestion to use the ggthemes package to make the final replication appear closer to the original by adding the theme_538() function. I received multiple errors about not being able to find this function, so ChatGPT suggested creating my own function to mimic the 538 theme. This change removed the gridlines in the background and adjusted the sizing of the x-axis labels to match the original graph more closely.\n\n# create a function to mimic the 538 style\ntheme_538 &lt;- function() {\n  theme_minimal() +\n    theme(\n      axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n      axis.text = element_text(size = 10),\n      panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n      panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n      panel.border = element_blank(),\n      panel.background = element_blank(),\n      axis.line = element_line(color = \"black\"),\n      axis.ticks = element_line(color = \"black\"),\n      plot.title = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.5)\n    )\n}\n\n# apply the 538 style function and add labels to dates of interest\ngraph4 &lt;- ggplot(concern_data_long, aes(x = end_date, y = Percentage, color = `Concern Level`)) +\n    geom_line() +\n    theme_538() +\n    scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#800080\",\"#BA55D3\",\"#FFDAB9\",\"#FF0000\")) +\n    labs(title = \"How worried are Americans about infection?\",\n         subtitle = paste(\"How concerned Americans say they are that they, someone in their family or someone else they know will\", \"\\n\", \"become infected with the coronavirus\")) +\n    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10), \n          plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 8)) +\n    scale_x_date(breaks = breaks, labels = custom_labels) +\n    xlab(NULL) + \n    guides(color = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE)) +\n    geom_vline(xintercept = as.Date(\"2020-02-29\"), linetype = \"dashed\") + \n    geom_vline(xintercept = as.Date(\"2020-05-28\"), linetype = \"dashed\") +\n    geom_vline(xintercept = as.Date(\"2020-10-02\"), linetype = \"dashed\") +\n    geom_vline(xintercept = as.Date(\"2020-11-07\"), linetype = \"dashed\") +\n    geom_vline(xintercept = as.Date(\"2021-01-20\"), linetype = \"dashed\") +\n    geom_text(aes(x = as.Date(\"2020-02-29\"), y = 55, label = paste(\"First U.S.\", \"\\n\", \"death reported\")), size = 3, angle = 0, vjust = 0, fontface = \"italic\", color = \"black\") + \n  geom_text(aes(x = as.Date(\"2020-05-28\"), y = 55, label = paste(\"U.S. deaths\", \"\\n\", \"surpass 100,000\")), size = 3, angle = 0, vjust = 0, fontface = \"italic\", color = \"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x = as.Date(\"2020-10-02\"), y = 48, label = paste(\"Trump diagnosed\", \"\\n\", \"with COVID-19\")), size = 3, angle = 0, vjust = 0, fontface = \"italic\", color = \"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x = as.Date(\"2020-11-07\"), y = 57, label = paste(\"Biden declared\", \"\\n\", \"election winner\")), size = 3, angle = 0, vjust = 0, fontface = \"italic\", color = \"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x = as.Date(\"2021-01-20\"), y = 55, label = paste(\"Biden sworn\", \"\\n\", \"into office\")), size = 3, angle = 0, vjust = 0, fontface = \"italic\", color = \"black\")\ngraph4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal graph included again for quick comparison. \nSince Dr. Handel recommended that new users begin with the gt package when creating tables, I specifically asked ChatGPT to use that package with this prompt: R code using the gt package to create a table displaying the percentages for four categories (very, somewhat, not very, not at all) for each daily observation. I am using the same data from the exercise above, which is stored as concern_data2.\nThe original code provided by ChatGPT had outdated syntax in the column argument of the tab_spanner() function, so I updated that using the simple c() function. I also had to add the real variable names found in concern_data2.\n\n# load packages\nlibrary(gt)\n\n# generate first attempt at publication quality table\ntable1 &lt;- concern_data2 %&gt;%\n  gt()

first table looks decent, but I want to clean up a few things stylistically. I added a more descriptive title and renamed the columns, so the table would not contain variable names. Following my classmate Erick’s suggestion, I created a new variable, month to summarize the data in the original table to make it more useful. I felt like it was unnecessary to have 5 decimal points for each percentage, so I limited the decimals to 1 place when I created the new average percentages by month. The result is a clean and publication-quality table that is much easier to digest than the original.\n\n# load packages required to manipulate dates\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\n# create new month variable to summarize the table and rename columns\ncovid_summary &lt;- concern_data2 %&gt;%\n  mutate(month = floor_date(as.Date(end_date, format = \"%Y-%m-%d\"), \"month\")) %&gt;% \n  group_by(month) %&gt;% #Group by month of the year\n  summarise(avg_very_percent = round(mean(very_percent, na.rm = TRUE), 1),\n            avg_somewhat_percent = round(mean(somewhat_percent, na.rm = TRUE), 1),\n            avg_not_very_percent = round(mean(not_very_percent, na.rm = TRUE), 1),\n            avg_not_at_all_percent = round(mean(not_at_all_percent, na.rm = TRUE), 1)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(starts_with(\"avg_\"), ~ as.numeric(format(., nsmall = 2)))) %&gt;% \n  rename(Month = \"month\", \n         Very = \"avg_very_percent\",\n         Somewhat = \"avg_somewhat_percent\",\n         `Not very` = \"avg_not_very_percent\",\n         `Not at all` = \"avg_not_at_all_percent\")\n\n## generate table with proper labels\ntable2 &lt;- covid_summary %&gt;% \n  gt() %&gt;%\n  tab_spanner(label = \"Percentage\",\n              columns = c(\"Very\", \"Somewhat\", \"Not very\", \"Not at all\")) %&gt;%\n  tab_header(title = \"Levels of concern about COVID-19 infections among Americans\") %&gt;% \n  fmt_number(columns = c(\"Very\", \"Somewhat\", \"Not very\", \"Not at all\"),\n             decimals = 1)\ntable2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevels of concern about COVID-19 infections among Americans\n\n\nMonth\nPercentage\n\n\nVery\nSomewhat\nNot very\nNot at all\n\n\n\n\n2020-02-01\n14.1\n26.6\n36.6\n19.4\n\n\n2020-03-01\n28.7\n35.2\n24.3\n10.9\n\n\n2020-04-01\n35.8\n37.0\n19.2\n7.4\n\n\n2020-05-01\n31.7\n36.3\n21.2\n10.1\n\n\n2020-06-01\n26.4\n37.0\n22.5\n13.0\n\n\n2020-07-01\n33.0\n35.7\n19.4\n10.4\n\n\n2020-08-01\n30.3\n36.2\n20.4\n11.5\n\n\n2020-09-01\n29.0\n35.4\n21.5\n12.8\n\n\n2020-10-01\n29.7\n36.3\n20.0\n12.9\n\n\n2020-11-01\n29.9\n34.5\n19.8\n14.5\n\n\n2020-12-01\n35.1\n33.7\n19.5\n11.8\n\n\n2021-01-01\n31.6\n33.2\n18.2\n13.4\n\n\n2021-02-01\n29.6\n33.6\n20.0\n14.4\n\n\n2021-03-01\n27.2\n35.0\n25.0\n14.2\n\n\n2021-04-01\n19.0\n32.0\n27.2\n18.8"

The questionnaire collected data about their current symptoms and activity level. A response was required for all symptom-related questions when they scheduled their appointments. We included all symptoms collected by the questionnaire in this analysis. The complete questionnaire is available in the supplementary material.\nFor the symptoms of cough, weakness, and body aches, the patient graded the severity of the symptom as none, mild, moderate, and severe. The patient recorded all other symptom data as present or absent. The patient also reported any changes in their normal behavior. Patients describe their activity level as a number between 0 and 10, with 10 indicating no change in regular activity and 0 being bedridden.\nThe study population includes all patients with a diagnosis of influenza. The data and results presented in the main text includes patients diagnosed with a rapid antigen or rapid PCR test. To address the impact of the influenza diagnosis method, we performed the same analyses for all patients diagnosed with influenza regardless of the method used. These results are shown in the supplementary material.\nThe institutional review board approved the study protocol."

    "text": "Analysis\nWe assessed the univariate relationships between activity and each symptom using linear regression treating activity level as a continuous variable. We also performed multiple linear regression. We determined the variables to include in our final model with a sequential forward floating selection, minimizing the root mean square error (RMSE) on test data through a 5-fold cross-validation (20 times repeated) [28].\nNext, we constructed two cumulative scores, one for overall infectiousness and one for overall morbidity. To that end, we divided all symptoms into those related to infectiousness and those related to morbidity (SM Table 1). We defined morbidity symptoms as symptoms that influence overall feelings of well-being but are not associated with infectiousness. Infectiousness symptoms are any symptoms that could plausibly contribute to passing the virus from an infected host to a susceptible host [29,30]. Importantly, the grouping of variables into either the morbidity or infectiousness symptom categories was based on a priori medical and biologic considerations, independently of any observed correlation with activity level. Doing so prevents any circular reasoning since only including symptoms correlated with activity would, of course, generate a score which would match the impact on activity level. These scores are similar to systemic and respiratory scores used in past studies of influenza infection [29,31,32]. The scores are computed as a sum of the symptoms that are present. Our data did not allow us to take into account symptom severity, though a comparison of our scores with cough, weakness, and body aches, for which we have severity, shows that there is a good positive correlation between strength and number of symptoms (see SM). To test the robustness of our results, we completed several sensitivity analyses using different approaches to generate the scores. Results from these analyses are shown in the SM.\nCorrelations between the infectiousness score, morbidity score, and activity were assessed using Spearman correlation [33] and the generalized Mantel–Haenszel procedure [34]. Linear regression is used to estimate the average change in activity, and the lines are included in the plots to help visualize the relationships. All analyses were completed using R (version 3.5.3) [35]. We used the mlr package for cross-validation [36], vcdExtra to compute Yule’s Q and the CHM trend test [37], DescTools to compute Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient and corresponding confidence intervals [38]. All of the code and data required to reproduce the results are available through Dryad."

For analyses of patients who received a flu diagnosis based on lab tests or empirically from a physician, see the SM. Patients with influenza reported activity levels ranging from 0 to 10 with a median of 4 (SM Figure 1). All of the patients reported symptoms, with only 14% reporting 9 or fewer (max possible 25).

We found that the best performing model was one that included chills/sweats, subjective fever, headache, weakness, sleeplessness, and vomiting (SM Table 2).

Each symptom present in a patient contributed one point to their respective scores. For those symptoms for which we had severity, we investigated correlations with number of symptoms and found total number of symptoms to be a good proxy (see SM). Analyses using several alternative approaches for computing the score are shown in the SM and summarized below in the Sensitivity Analysis section.\nThe infectiousness score had a possible range of 0 to 5, and the morbidity score had a possible range of 0 to 20. The median infectiousness score was 4. Only 2 patients had an infectiousness score of 0, 20% had a score of 2 or less, and 28% of patients had the maximum possible score of 5. The mean morbidity score was 9.574, and no patients had a morbidity score of 0, 1, 19 or 20. The centered distribution is assumed to be the result of how patients were included in the study that is all the patients felt sick enough to seek medical care, but none were sick enough to require urgent care or hospitalization. Results presented in the SM show plots of the score distributions (SM Figure 2 A-B)."

Note however that the data suggest a non-linear relationship between infectiousness and activity. We cannot think of a biological mechanism that might lead to this pattern.

Since our data is measured in units with indirect and uncertain mapping to actual per-contact transmission potential and actual contact rate, we standardize the data and manually place it on top of the conceptual lines. This should not be considered a quantitative mapping.\nOur study population consisted of individuals who felt sick enough to seek medical care, but none were ill enough to require emergency care. It is thus a reasonable assumption to expect them to be somewhere in the middle of the virulence spectrum. Based on our data, this range is characterized by infectiousness levels that are increasing as morbidity (virulence) increases (Figure @ref(fig:HypoFigDATA)). Activity is more strongly impacted and decreases as morbidity increases. We speculate that a study population that included asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic infected persons would be on the left side of our data, while severely ill and hospitalized individuals would fall to the right side of our data.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheoretical framework and data for virulence mediated transmission trade-off. Morbidity score is a proxy for virulence, infectiousness score is a proxy for per-contact transmission potential, and activity level is a proxy for contact rate. The values for infectiousness and activity are re-scaled to allow better visualization. Lines are adjusted to pass through data. Thus, this figure does not show a fit but instead a conceptual framework in which our data can be placed and interpreted."

As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata2.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

For instance you could create a folder for figures, another for tables. Or you could create a sub-folder for dataset 1, another for dataset 2. Or you could have a subfolder for exploratory analysis, another for final analysis. The options are endless, choose whatever makes sense for your project.
